q1) What was the primary outcome for the original Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)?
answer:  Answer: The primary outcome for the original Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) was the development of diabetes, defined by 1997 ADA criteria.
context: was unknown. Moreover, determining whether the delay or prevention of diabetes would 
translate into a decrease in retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease, all 
of which require more years to develop than the DPP period of study, was critical to establish the 
true impact of the DPP on public health.  
The long-term follow-up study of the DPP, entitled the Diabetes Prevention Program 
Outcomes Study (DPPOS, 2002-2015), was designed to take further advantage of the

morbidity and mortality.  However, the duration of the DPP, planned as a 3-6 year study, did not 
allow an examination of whether “prevention” or delay of diabetes would translate into a 
reduction of clinical outcomes that usually require a longer period of time to develop.  Thus, the 
DPP was designed on the basis of power calculations directed at diabetes prevention4.  The 
ability to demonstrate a reduction in microvascular complications or “hard” CVD outcomes was

from the beginning of DPP. 
The cohort of participants for this analysis were a subset of the original DPP study 
population, and as such were no longer “randomized”, but rather selected by having survived 
DPP without developing diabetes.  Beyond that selection, each participant was included in the 
group to which s/he was randomly assigned, regardless of compliance with study treatment. The 
number of participants who had not developed diabetes at DPP study end was 870 in the

The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP, 1994-2001) was a multicenter controlled 
clinical trial examining the efficacy of an intensive lifestyle intervention or metformin to prevent 
or delay the development of diabetes in a population selected to be at high risk due to the 
presence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).  Development of diabetes, defined by 1997 ADA 
criteria, was the primary outcome while cardiovascular disease and its risk factors were

q2) Which groups were originally included in the DPP randomization, and which one was discontinued early?
answer:  Answer: All participants who enrolled in DPPOS were originally included in the DPP randomization except for those assigned to troglitazone, as it was discontinued early due to safety concerns.
context: included in the group to which s/he was randomly assigned, regardless of compliance with study 
treatment. Since the participants originally assigned to troglitazone only had a limited exposure 
to that intervention, owing to the premature termination of the troglitazone arm, were not 
included in the primary DPP outcome analyses, and are no longer followed in DPPOS, they will 
not be included in the primary DPPOS Phase 3 analyses.

following characteristics: racial/ethnic origin, sex, and age (<45, 45-<60, 60+). 
The primary analyses that focused on the intention-to-treat assignment during DPP 
included all participants in the original DPP placebo, lifestyle and metformin intervention groups 
who enrolled in DPPOS. Since the participants originally assigned to troglitazone only had a 
limited exposure to that intervention, owing to the premature termination of the troglitazone arm,

DPP interval, and any subsequent comparison encompassing that interval would not be an 
independent analysis; and 2) since the interventions were indeed effective over the earlier DPP 
interval, the cumulative incidence curves may have had too much separation from the early DPP 
effects to be able come together again, even if the interventions were not effective over the 
longer term.  The primary analysis from DPPOS baseline did not preclude secondary analyses 
from the beginning of DPP.

q3) What is the primary objective of DPPOS Phase 3?
answer:  The primary objective of DPPOS Phase 3 is to evaluate the long-term effects of metformin compared with placebo on the incidence of cancer and of major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (MACE: fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, and other cardiovascular deaths), with the comparisons of lifestyle compared with placebo, and lifestyle

monitor the emerging results to assess treatment effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, and participant

quality.  Highlights of completed analyses related to study papers will be presented as they 
become available.  During DPPOS Phase 2, there were two formal interim analyses of safety and 
efficacy pertaining to macrovascular events for purposes of possible "early stopping" of an 
intervention. The DSMB will develop a safety monitoring plan for DPPOS Phase 3 to include a 
futility assessment.

The duration of follow-up in the first five years of DPPOS was extended by one year 
from 5 to 6 years, by NIDDK.  Power calculations were modified based on actual enrollment, 
and to correspond to the reordering of outcome measures.   
 
The following assumptions were used to make revised estimates of the power of the

OBJECTIVES 
 
2.1. 
Primary  
 
The primary objective of DPPOS Phase 1 was to evaluate the long-term effects of active 
DPP interventions on the further development of diabetes. The primary objective of the DPPOS 
Phase 2 was to evaluate the long-term effects of the DPP interventions (Intensive Lifestyle and 
Metformin) on the prevalence of the composite diabetes-related microangiopathic and

DPP/DPPOS interventions on cancer (first 5 years) and cardiovascular disease (second 5 years), 
with a particular focus on the effects of the metformin intervention. 
The secondary objectives of DPPOS Phase 3 are to evaluate the long-term effects of 
DPP interventions on the further development of diabetes, microvascular and selected health 
outcomes, the established and putative risk factors for those outcomes, and the costs and cost-
utility associated with delay or prevention of diabetes.

term CVD. This is a question we will be able to address in DPPOS Phase 3. 
In summary, further follow-up of DPPOS presents the unique opportunity to evaluate the 
effects of metformin begun during pre-diabetes vs PLB or ILS on CVD, the effects of ILS on 
CVD, and associations between T2DM prevention and CVD.

A focus on cancer is new for DPPOS Phase 3. The randomized metformin exposure

data and results from recent studies. Given our best estimate of the accumulation of events, and 
using effect sizes of 25 or 30%, we expect to reach the level of required cancer events in the 
placebo group during the first 5-years of DPPOS Phase 3, and the required MACE events in the 
placebo group during the second 5-years of DPPOS Phase 3.
==================================================

q5) Why was it critical to establish a long-term follow-up study like DPPOS after the initial DPP concluded?
answer:  It was critical to establish a long-term follow-up study like DPPOS after the initial DPP concluded because the Research Group wanted to determine whether the delay or prevention of diabetes would translate into a decrease in retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease, all of which require more years to develop than the DPP period of study. Additionally, they wanted to appreciate the long-term clinical impact of diabetes prevention and increase their understanding of the clinical course of IGT and new-onset type 2 diabetes.
context: with our obligation to the participants who had made the DPP possible.  Although this decision 
was not based on any scientific imperative, the Research Group did not think that it would 
interfere with the follow-up study as designed.  Continuing to apply the DPP interventions 
during DPPOS was based on the expectation that a positive effect of DPP interventions on long-
term health outcomes would more likely be obtained if the interventions that were effective in

was unknown. Moreover, determining whether the delay or prevention of diabetes would 
translate into a decrease in retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease, all 
of which require more years to develop than the DPP period of study, was critical to establish the 
true impact of the DPP on public health.  
The long-term follow-up study of the DPP, entitled the Diabetes Prevention Program 
Outcomes Study (DPPOS, 2002-2015), was designed to take further advantage of the

At the end of DPP, 99.6% of the study cohort was alive. The entire cohort proved to be 
remarkably compliant, with 94% retention of volunteers over time, and completion of > 90% of 
study requirements. Adherence (>80% of assigned medication) to metformin was 72%.  
 
11.2. Study Power 
 
11.2.1. Power for the Development of Diabetes  
 
The duration of follow-up in the first five years of DPPOS was extended by one year

period of the DPP, with a mean follow-up of 2.8 years (range 1.8-4.8 years), precluded an 
examination of the long-term clinical impact of diabetes prevention.  An appreciation of the 
long-term clinical impact of diabetes prevention is critical in order to understand the role of the 
DPP interventions in improving health.  Moreover, the long-term epidemiological follow-up of 
the DPP cohort would increase our understanding of the clinical course of IGT and new-onset 
type 2 diabetes.
==================================================

q6) What were the results of the DPP Phase 1 regarding diabetes incidence reductions?
answer:  Answer: The primary objective for DPPOS Phase 1 was to compare the durability of the original effect during the DPP, i.e., estimation of the hazard rates for development of diabetes going forward among participants who had not developed diabetes during DPP among those who were randomly assigned to intensive lifestyle changes (ILS), metformin, and placebo (PLB). At year 15 (the end of DPPOS Phase 2), cumulative diabetes incidence was 52% of those originally assigned to ILS, 55% of those originally assigned to MET, and 60% of those originally assigned to PLB.
context: less than would be predicted despite the majority of each group having made the transition to 
biochemically diagnosed diabetes.  
 
3.2.4. DPPOS Phase 2 Results: Impact of DPP Interventions on Microvascular Disease 
 
The second question addressed in DPPOS Phase 2 was the long-term clinical impact of 
having prevented or delayed the onset of diabetes, specifically the effects of DPP interventions 
on diabetes-related complications.  The ultimate health care benefit of diabetes “prevention” was

 Study Population 
 
All surviving DPP participants, assigned to the original intensive lifestyle, metformin, 
troglitazone, and placebo groups, whether or not they developed diabetes during the DPP, were 
eligible and were invited to join DPPOS.  The former troglitazone participants were followed 
during Phase 1 of DPPOS, but no longer participate as research volunteers in the study.  At the

class offered to all participants. During DPPOS Phases 1 & 2, and Phase 3, metformin was and 
will be provided to all participants who were receiving metformin treatment in DPP, assuming 
that HbA1c is <7.0% and the participant has not developed a contraindication or intolerance to 
metformin, in order to maintain long-term intervention with this agent.  (See section 7.2.2 
regarding HbA1c ≥ 7.0%.)  The provision of lifestyle training to the DPP PLB group during
==================================================

q7) Does the protocol state that the placebo group received no intervention during the DPPOS follow-up?
answer:  No, the protocol does not state that the placebo group received no intervention during the DPPOS follow-up. The protocol states that the placebo group received lifestyle intervention during the DPPOS follow-up.
context: beginning with protocol version 3.0, all participants will continue their scheduled follow-up 
visits for the duration of DPPOS regardless of their level of compliance with the assigned 
treatment.  Outcome and safety assessments will be conducted according to the schedule in 
section 12. 
Beginning in study year 13 and continuing in DPPOS Phase 3, in-person annual visits 
will continue with reduced intensity of outcome measurements according to the outcomes

with our obligation to the participants who had made the DPP possible.  Although this decision 
was not based on any scientific imperative, the Research Group did not think that it would 
interfere with the follow-up study as designed.  Continuing to apply the DPP interventions 
during DPPOS was based on the expectation that a positive effect of DPP interventions on long-
term health outcomes would more likely be obtained if the interventions that were effective in

included in the group to which s/he was randomly assigned, regardless of compliance with study 
treatment. Since the participants originally assigned to troglitazone only had a limited exposure 
to that intervention, owing to the premature termination of the troglitazone arm, were not 
included in the primary DPP outcome analyses, and are no longer followed in DPPOS, they will 
not be included in the primary DPPOS Phase 3 analyses.

lifestyle modification reduced the development of diabetes, compared with placebo, in subjects 
with IGT during a period of intervention averaging 4 years. Owing to the large and statistically 
significant reduction in development of diabetes in the lifestyle intervention group (58%) and in 
the metformin-treated group (31%), compared with placebo treatment, the DPP was ended, by 
consensus of the external Data Monitoring Board, NIDDK, and the Study Group, approximately

data and results from recent studies. Given our best estimate of the accumulation of events, and 
using effect sizes of 25 or 30%, we expect to reach the level of required cancer events in the 
placebo group during the first 5-years of DPPOS Phase 3, and the required MACE events in the 
placebo group during the second 5-years of DPPOS Phase 3.

term health outcomes would more likely be obtained if the interventions that were effective in 
DPP were maintained to some degree in the DPPOS, recognizing that the DPP placebo group 
would now receive lifestyle intervention as well.  This design for DPPOS was thought more 
likely to minimize confounding of the effects of the past DPP interventions through the 
introduction of non-standardized therapies by participants and their health care providers.
==================================================

q8) What findings from the UKPDS study support the rationale for the 10-year follow-up in DPPOS?
answer:  Information not found in protocol.
context: take longer to observe than the initial ~15 years of the DPP/DPPOS Phases 1 & 2. Continuation 
of the study in DPPOS Phase 3 presents the unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of MET 
begun during pre-diabetes vs PLB or ILS on CVD, the effects of ILS on CVD, and associations 
between T2DM prevention and CVD.

Retention of participants throughout the study period is key to both the power and 
generalizability of DPPOS findings.  Retention of DPPOS participants will be encouraged 
through the provision of social support from DPPOS staff during clinic visits, group meetings, 
and other incentives.  All participants receive an honorarium, at scheduled visits, in recognition 
of the time and effort spent in the DPPOS.

There is a strong rationale for continued follow-up of the DPP/DPPOS cohort. The 
randomized study assignments at baseline provide a unique opportunity to evaluate metformin’s 
putative effects on CVD and cancer outcomes, which have been proposed in recent years. More 
generally, the random assignments allow long-term prospective intention-to-treat analyses.  The 
population has been highly adherent to study procedures and study therapies, and between-group
==================================================

q9) How is the 'MACE' outcome defined in DPPOS Phase 3?
answer:  In DPPOS Phase 3, the primary outcome is the time to the development of cancer or major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (MACE), which includes nonfatal or fatal myocardial infarction or stroke or any cardiovascular death occurring since DPP randomization.
context: This substitutes for the occurrence of nephropathy at year 11. 
 
DPPOS Phase 3 
The primary outcome for DPPOS Phase 3 is time to the development of cancer and of 
major atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (MACE).  The cancer outcome includes the first 
occurrence of a new cancer diagnosed since DPP randomization and is the primary outcome 
during the first 5 years of DPPOS Phase 3, while MACE includes any of the following: nonfatal

MACE events are collected at every visit using a standard medical history questionnaire and 
adjudicated by reviewers who are blinded to treatment assignment. 
 
SECONDARY OUTCOMES (outcomes assessed in Phases 1 & 2 but discontinued in DPPOS 
Phase 3 are shown in brackets) 
• Further development of diabetes  
• Diabetic retinopathy

during the first 5 years of DPPOS Phase 3, while MACE includes any of the following: nonfatal 
or fatal myocardial infarction or stroke or any cardiovascular death occurring since DPP 
randomization. The first occurrence of a new MACE event since DPP randomization is the 
primary outcome during the second 5 years of DPPOS Phase 3.  The occurrence of cancer and 
MACE events are collected at every visit using a standard medical history questionnaire and

individual elements of the neurologic sensory examination.  
 
4.1.3. Cardiovascular Disease  
  
The primary outcome of the second 5-years of DPPOS Phase 3 is the incidence of major 
cardiovascular disease (MACE).  MACE is defined as the time to first occurrence after DPP 
randomization of one or more of the following: fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and 
stroke or other cardiovascular death.   
 The composite diabetes-related cardiovascular disease secondary outcome is defined as

sensation, as recommended in the 2017 ADA Position statement94. The MNSI questionnaire and 
the monofilament test will be continued, as in past examinations, to allow longitudinal analyses. 
The principal outcome for DSPN in DPPOS Phase 3 will be defined as the presence of DSPN 
symptoms (score ≥4 on the MNSI questionnaire)95 or any signs of bilateral DSPN. The signs of 
bilateral DSPN require abnormal finding on both toes for pinprick testing (score ≥5)96, for

q10) What are the components of the 'composite diabetes-related microangiopathic and neuropathic outcome' used in Phase 2?
answer:  The components of the 'composite diabetes-related microangiopathic and neuropathic outcome' used in Phase 2 include: 

1. Nephropathy: increased albuminuria (≥30 mg/gram creatinine, confirmed), or renal dysfunction (end-stage renal disease, dialysis or renal transplant) or eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2. 
2. Retinopathy: presence of retinal hard exudates, venous beading, intraretinal hemorrhages, or laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy.

q11) What is the diagnostic threshold for diabetic retinopathy in DPPOS Phase 3?
answer:  Answer: In DPPOS Phase 3, the diagnostic threshold for diabetic retinopathy is based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grading system. This includes mild diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS≥35), moderate diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS≥50), severe diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS≥70), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS≥80).
context: (ETDRS≥20) as used in DPPOS Phase 2 to mild diabetic retinopathy (ETDRS≥35)16 or 
adjudicated treatment for retinopathy. Macular edema by optical coherence tomography 
(OCT)92,93 will be a secondary outcome. The ETDRS grade was modified in recognition of the 
expected increase in time and level of hyperglycemia that will result in more diabetes-specific 
lesions and to minimize noise from aging related retinal findings. Spectral domain OCT is a

Of note, the diabetes ascertainment methods employed in the DPP/DPPOS identify the 
transition to diabetes at an earlier stage than is seen in traditional clinical care. The mean fasting

preventing diabetes over 3 years, there would be no compelling reason to stop DPPOS for having 
demonstrated further benefit.  The assessment of the composite microangiopathy occurred after 
the year 11 visits.  Therefore, we did not implement a formal statistical monitoring plan for either 
of these outcomes in DPPOS.  The DSMB reviewed two interim analyses of time to

and circulating proteins exposed to glucose, it should come as no surprise that there may be no 
specific threshold where one finds diabetic complications; rather, there may be a continuum of 
risk associated with glycemia, including in the sub-diabetic range. Through studies of pre-

Most reported studies suggest that the risk for CHD in IGT is intermediate between that

and those with IGT, and others have found differences in men or women only70,71.  Most of these 
studies were cross-sectional and many of the older surveys did not utilize the WHO diagnostic

answer:  Answer: Nephropathy is defined as development of any of the following: albuminuria ≥30 mg/g creatinine in a spot urine collection on 2 consecutive tests or an estimated eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2, based on annual serum creatinine using the CKD-EPI equation15 on 2 consecutive tests, or renal failure (end-stage kidney disease).
context: For DPPOS Phase 3, the main composite diabetes-related microangiopathic outcome, 
now a secondary outcome, is defined as time to first occurrence of nephropathy or retinopathy, 
the two microvascular disease components that are most objectively measured microvascular 
complications. Nephropathy is adapted from KDIGO91 for categories of moderately increased 
albuminuria or moderately to severely decreased eGFR and defined as development of any of the

For this set of analyses the pre-specified primary outcome was an aggregate of 
microvascular diseases, defined as the presence of one or more of nephropathy, retinopathy or 
neuropathy. Nephropathy was defined as albuminuria ≥30 mg/g creatinine in a spot urine 
collection on 2 consecutive tests or an estimated eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2, based on annual 
serum creatinine using the CKD-EPI equation15 on 2 consecutive tests, or renal failure (end-stage

If a participant was taking antihypertensive drugs at the last assessment and did not meet 
the ACR or eGFR criteria at that time, he or she was considered to have reached the

4.1.3. Cardiovascular Disease  
  
The primary outcome of the second 5-years of DPPOS Phase 3 is the incidence of major 
cardiovascular disease (MACE).  MACE is defined as the time to first occurrence after DPP 
randomization of one or more of the following: fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and

q13) What is the primary difference in the visit schedule between DPPOS Phases 1 & 2 and Phase 3?
answer:  Information not found in protocol.
context: take longer to observe than the initial ~15 years of the DPP/DPPOS Phases 1 & 2. Continuation 
of the study in DPPOS Phase 3 presents the unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of MET 
begun during pre-diabetes vs PLB or ILS on CVD, the effects of ILS on CVD, and associations 
between T2DM prevention and CVD.  
 
3.3. 
DPPOS Phase 3 (2015-2025)  
 
 
There is a strong rationale for continued follow-up of the DPP/DPPOS cohort. The

beginning with protocol version 3.0, all participants will continue their scheduled follow-up 
visits for the duration of DPPOS regardless of their level of compliance with the assigned 
treatment.  Outcome and safety assessments will be conducted according to the schedule in 
section 12. 
Beginning in study year 13 and continuing in DPPOS Phase 3, in-person annual visits 
will continue with reduced intensity of outcome measurements according to the outcomes

DPPOS, the intervention groups did not differ from the controls in the hazard rates for 
development of diabetes over the interval from the beginning of DPPOS.  Reasons for comparing 
across the interval from the start of DPPOS as the primary analysis rather than from the 
beginning of DPP were: 1) we had already published the comparison of the three groups over the 
DPP interval, and any subsequent comparison encompassing that interval would not be an

-13.49 
 
 
The DPP and DPPOS Phases 1 & 2 had insufficient power to detect an effect of the two 
active DPP interventions on CVD events owing to the relatively low rate of CVD events during 
the study.  Although the low event rates of major CVD precluded demonstrating a difference in 
event rates between the treatment groups, CVD risk factors were variably affected by the 
different DPP interventions.  (Table 4)  Blood pressure was significantly lower, lipid levels were

cardiovascular deaths), with the comparisons of lifestyle compared with placebo, and lifestyle 
compared with metformin, important secondary objectives.  Major secondary comparisons will 
be lifestyle vs. placebo and metformin vs. lifestyle. 
 
2.2.

The secondary objective of the DPPOS (DPPOS outcomes assessed in Phases 1 & 2 but 
discontinued in Phase 3 are shown in brackets) is to evaluate the long-term effects of DPP 
interventions on selected health outcomes including:

q14) How are troglitazone participants handled in the DPPOS Phase 3 analysis?
answer:  Troglitazone participants are not included in the primary DPPOS Phase 3 analyses since they were not originally part of the primary DPP outcome analyses and have been discontinued from the study. They will, however, be included in secondary analyses exploring the relationship between incident diabetes and determinants of long-term complications of new-onset diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance.
context: included in the group to which s/he was randomly assigned, regardless of compliance with study 
treatment. Since the participants originally assigned to troglitazone only had a limited exposure 
to that intervention, owing to the premature termination of the troglitazone arm, were not 
included in the primary DPP outcome analyses, and are no longer followed in DPPOS, they will 
not be included in the primary DPPOS Phase 3 analyses.

during Phase 1 of DPPOS, but no longer participate as research volunteers in the study.  At the 
time that DPPOS was initiated in September 2002, the mean age of the study population 
(including the former troglitazone participants) was 55 years, with 68% being women.  Fifty-five 
percent were Caucasian, 20% African-American, 16% Hispanic American, 5% American Indian, 
and 4% Asian or Pacific Islander-American.  A total of 2776 participants consented to participate

analyses, treatment assignment during the DPP will be considered a covariate. 
The former troglitazone participants who continue in the DPPOS through visit year 6 will 
be included in the "other" outcomes exploring the relationship between incident diabetes and 
determinants of long-term complications of new-onset diabetes and IGT. No research data will

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
8.1. 
Definitions 
 
Only adverse events meeting the criteria for serious will be ascertained and reported to 
the DSMB following FDA guidelines.  Serious adverse events have been defined to include any 
adverse experience that results in any of the following outcomes: 
* Death 
* A life-threatening adverse experience 
* Overdose to any medication

of all life-threatening or fatal SUSARs (Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction) within 
seven calendar days; NIDDK must notify the FDA of all other SUSARs by 15 calendar days.  
 
All serious adverse events will be reported to local IRBs by the clinic following 
individual institutional guidelines.

serious if, based on appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the 
participant and would require medical or surgical intervention to prevent a 
serious adverse event. 
 
8.2. 
Eliciting and Recording Serious Adverse Events 
 
Reporting of serious adverse events will be accomplished by collecting information on 
these adverse experiences during annual, semi-annual and interim follow-up visits. In order to 
avoid bias in eliciting serious adverse events, these adverse events will be assessed using a

Coordinating Center as they occur through routine data entry (within 2-3 days), with the 
exception of death or other life threatening and unexpected adverse events.  All deaths or other 
life threatening and unexpected adverse events, regardless of intervention assignment, must be 
reported to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours of clinic notification. The Coordinating 
Center will transmit the death report to the NIDDK Program Official.

q23) What is the process for editing data forms once they are completed at a clinical center?
answer:  Once completed at a clinical center, data forms undergo several processes before they are entered into the data management system. First, the clinic staff, directed by the program coordinator, review the completed data forms prior to data entry. Then, the forms are edited as they are entered into the data management system, and again via the central data management system at the CoC. Weekly audit programs also produce more detailed edits across forms for an individual participant. Summaries are prepared for reports to the Steering Committee and Protocol Oversight Program.

factors.  Secondary outcomes may be assessed in the study population as a whole or in subsets, 
depending on feasibility, cost and the likelihood of deriving significant results from a subset.  All 
biochemical laboratory outcomes will be measured at the DPPOS Central Biochemistry 
Laboratory.  Clinical center staff and study participants are notified if a secondary outcome result

 Other Secondary Outcomes 
 
The DPPOS secondary outcomes were selected for their importance to the clinical and 
scientific interpretation of the study.  They might help explain the mechanism of the primary 
outcome results, or shed light on how the interventions affect secondary outcomes and their risk

quality.  Missing data, particularly on outcome variables, will effectively reduce the power of 
analyses.  In fact, systematic patterns of missing data could bias the study results.  Therefore, 
many of the procedural details outlined in the Manual of Operations are designed to minimize 
the amount of missing data.

microangiopathy outcome using the global test1  The global test, which gives the component 
outcomes equal weight, is interpreted as testing for a consistent difference between groups across 
the component outcomes. 
The primary analysis for DPPOS Phase 3 will focus on the effects of metformin

q25) How is the study powered to detect a hazard risk reduction in MACE?
answer:  The study is powered to detect a hazard risk reduction in MACE by requiring 145 placebo events to detect a 30% hazard risk reduction in the primary comparison of metformin and placebo with 85% power and a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using a log-rank test.
context: after 5 and 10 additional years of DPPOS Phase 3 assuming a 1.04% loss to follow-up per year. 
To detect a 30% hazard risk reduction in MACE incidence in the primary comparison of 
metformin and placebo with 85% power and a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 using a log-rank 
test, we require 145 placebo events.   With the expected 156 events in the placebo group by 
2025, the study will have 89% power to detect a 30% hazard risk reduction. Other important

incidence rate of 1.86% by 2020 and an annual loss to follow-up of 1.04%, the projected 199 
cancer events in the placebo group will provide 89% power to detect a 28% hazard risk reduction 
at the end of the first 5-year period.  For MACE, we estimate an age related 2.1 fold increase in 
annual incidence rate in the next 10 years. This conservative increase is used to project events in

170 events in the placebo group using a log-rank test.  Assuming an increasing annual incidence 
rate of 1.86% by 2020 and an annual loss to follow-up of 1.04%, the projected 199 events in the 
placebo group will provide 89% power to detect a 28% hazard risk reduction at the end of the 
first 5-year period.  Secondary analysis of the cancer incidence between metformin and placebo 
separately by men and women will be assessed in the second 5-years.

q26) What significance level is used for the primary outcome analysis in DPPOS Phase 1?
answer:  Answer: The primary outcome analysis in DPPOS Phase 1 uses a significance level of 0.025.
context: The duration of follow-up in the first five years of DPPOS was extended by one year 
from 5 to 6 years, by NIDDK.  Power calculations were modified based on actual enrollment, 
and to correspond to the reordering of outcome measures.   
 
The following assumptions were used to make revised estimates of the power of the 
DPPOS for the Phase 1 primary outcome, development of diabetes: 
* The study will enroll approximately 900 participants per treatment group

included in the group to which s/he was randomly assigned, regardless of compliance with study 
treatment. Since the participants originally assigned to troglitazone only had a limited exposure 
to that intervention, owing to the premature termination of the troglitazone arm, were not 
included in the primary DPP outcome analyses, and are no longer followed in DPPOS, they will 
not be included in the primary DPPOS Phase 3 analyses.

* The study will enroll approximately 900 participants per treatment group 
* The Phase 1 primary outcome is time to the confirmed development of diabetes assessed 
from DPP randomization through DPPOS Phase 1. 
* Type I error rate of 0.05 (two-sided) with a Bonferroni adjustment for two pair-wise 
comparisons of the intervention groups vs. “control”. 
* Control (formerly placebo) group’s time to the development of diabetes is exponentially

number of participants who had not developed diabetes at DPP study end was 870 in the 
metformin group, 951 in the ILS, and 809 in the placebo group.  The primary outcome analysis 
used an overall significance level of α = 0.05 (2-sided). Two pair-wise comparisons between the 
intervention groups and the former placebo group, set at the = 0.025 level, were performed if the 
overall comparison was statistically significant. 
The analysis compared the treatment groups vs. the former placebo group on DPP

For the cancer outcome for DPPOS Phase 3, we estimated the number of cancer cases 
through the first 5 years of DPPOS Phase 3 using incidence rates based on both SEER100 and 
current DPPOS data.  To detect 28% risk reduction in cancer for the primary comparison of 
metformin vs placebo with 85% power for a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, the study requires 
170 events in the placebo group using a log-rank test.  Assuming an increasing annual incidence

limited exposure to that intervention, owing to the premature termination of the troglitazone arm, 
and were not included in the primary DPP outcome analyses, they were not included in the 
primary DPPOS analyses.

context: confirmed disease.  Participants who died or prematurely discontinue their follow-up visits prior 
to developing the event will be “censored” as of their last follow-up visit – hence, participants 
who did not enroll in DPPOS will be censored as of their last contact during DPP. Separate

not be included in the primary DPPOS Phase 3 analyses.  
The primary comparison will focus on the metformin vs. the placebo group.  The time to 
event analysis uses the date of the first occurrence of the outcomes.  Participants will be 
considered “administratively censored” if they complete the full duration of follow-up without 
confirmed disease.  Participants who died or prematurely discontinue their follow-up visits prior

beginning with protocol version 3.0, all participants will continue their scheduled follow-up 
visits for the duration of DPPOS regardless of their level of compliance with the assigned 
treatment.  Outcome and safety assessments will be conducted according to the schedule in 
section 12. 
Beginning in study year 13 and continuing in DPPOS Phase 3, in-person annual visits 
will continue with reduced intensity of outcome measurements according to the outcomes

preventing diabetes over 3 years, there would be no compelling reason to stop DPPOS for having 
demonstrated further benefit.  The assessment of the composite microangiopathy occurred after 
the year 11 visits.  Therefore, we did not implement a formal statistical monitoring plan for either 
of these outcomes in DPPOS.  The DSMB reviewed two interim analyses of time to

q28) What are the common side effects associated with Metformin mentioned in the protocol?
answer:  Answer: The common side effects associated with metformin mentioned in the protocol are gastrointestinal, including diarrhea, nausea, metallic taste, abdominal bloating, flatulence or anorexia.
context: plan should be based on clinical judgment taking into account the amount of time off metformin 
and the individual’s history of side effects.

levels will be measured, in participants taking study metformin. Women in the metformin 
treatment group will be asked to get immediate pregnancy testing if their menstrual cycles are 
more than one week overdue or they otherwise suspect they are pregnant.   
B. 
Potential Non-Gastrointestinal Side Effects 
Potential non-gastrointestinal side effects include, but are not limited to: headache, mild 
edema, leg cramps, arthralgia, myalgias, dizziness, mild rashes, and dysmenorrhea.  If non-

edema, leg cramps, arthralgia, myalgias, dizziness, mild rashes, and dysmenorrhea.  If non-
gastrointestinal side effects considered likely to be due to metformin occur and require cessation 
of metformin, it will be stopped for four weeks.  If the non-gastrointestinal symptoms disappear, 
a second attempt to introduce medications is made after the four weeks.  If symptoms re-occur, 
the metformin will again be discontinued.  Clinical judgment should be used to decide

with impaired glucose tolerance, reducing the development of diabetes by 31%. 
The most common side effects associated with metformin are gastrointestinal.  As many 
as 30% of persons report diarrhea, nausea, metallic taste, abdominal bloating, flatulence or 
anorexia.  These symptoms are generally transient, resolve spontaneously and can be avoided by 
gradual escalation of dosage.  Metformin is not associated with hypoglycemia unless used in

Women in the metformin treatment group will be asked to get immediate pregnancy 
testing if their menstrual cycles are more than one week overdue or they otherwise suspect they 
are pregnant. 
 
7.1.2. Use of Study Metformin During Pregnancy and Breast-feeding 
 
Metformin is contra-indicated in pregnancy although data on adverse effects on the fetus 
or the mother are scant.  The embryo toxic effects of biguanides have been evaluated in the in

costs associated with the DPP interventions that delay diabetes and, presumably, diabetes-
associated complications, would offset the costs of the interventions and therefore favorably 
affect the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. 
In DPPOS Phase 3 we will be able to extend these analyses to the effects of prevention 
of diabetes-related complications, incorporating the costs of screening and long-term treatment in

q29) When is Metformin treatment permanently discontinued due to kidney function?
answer:  Answer: Metformin will be discontinued permanently when the participant's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is less than 30 milliliters per minute per 1.73 square meters (mL/min/1.73 m2).
context: Version 4.4     May 22, 2019 
The Biostatistics Center, George Washington University

metformin will be discontinued permanently.  For participants who have an eGFR ≥30 and <45 
mL/minute/1.73 m2, the local PI can elect to continue metformin or stop it based on clinical 
judgment that takes into account the cause of renal dysfunction, anticipated clinical course and 
other factors. An interim serum creatinine measurement and calculated eGFR can be requested

abdominal pain or vomiting becomes severe enough to cause dehydration or volume depletion, 
metformin will be discontinued immediately and the participant will be evaluated and treated 
appropriately.   
E. 
Renal Insufficiency 
Serum creatinine safety measurements will be made yearly and eGFR calculated in 
participants in the metformin arm who are taking study metformin.  Metformin is not known to 
cause renal insufficiency.  However, it is associated with an increased risk for lactic acidosis if

eGFR is in the acceptable range (>30 mL/minute/1.73 m2). If the clinic is notified of a scheduled 
outpatient surgical procedure, the participant will be instructed to discontinue metformin the day 
prior to the procedure.   
L. 
Dermatological Reactions 
In the event of major dermatological reactions such as generalized urticaria, bullous 
rashes, exfoliative dermatitis or Stevens Johnson Syndrome, medication will be discontinued

used in persons with reduced kidney function. Metformin is contraindicated in those with eGFR 
<30 mL/minute/1.73 m2, and should be used with caution and reviewed in those with eGFR ≥30 
and <45 mL/minute/1.73 m2.  If eGFR levels are <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2, study-supplied

are taking metformin and that metformin needs to be discontinued prior to any radiological 
studies involving contrast dyes. 
I. 
Lactic Acidosis 
Metformin may rarely be associated with the development of lactic acidosis, defined as a 
metabolic acidosis with lactate ≥ 5.0 mM.  If hospitalization or an unexplained metabolic 
acidosis occurs, metformin will be discontinued immediately and not restarted.  The participant 
will be evaluated and treated appropriately.

PARTICIPANT MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS 
 
Each participant continues follow-up according to his or her original DPP randomized

intensive lifestyle (ILS) intervention, troglitazone (TRO) treatment (400 mg/day), metformin 
(MET) treatment (850 mg twice per day), or placebo (PLB).  All medication-treated subjects 
received identical appearing coded medications, and treatment was double blind.  Troglitazone 
treatment was stopped in June 1998, owing to the accumulating evidence that troglitazone was

diabetes.  Additional group lifestyle boost sessions were offered to the group originally assigned 
to intensive lifestyle intervention through spring 2014.  During DPPOS Phase 3, an annual 
lifestyle check-up will be offered to the original lifestyle group. Open label metformin therapy 
(850 mg twice per day) will continue to be provided to the participants originally assigned to 
metformin.  An annual group lifestyle session will be held for all participants.
